# TheServerArchives
An open source Discord bot that allows you to store every message sent.

If you wish to run this bot on a cloud network or raspberry pi, I have left the original code here with the setup checks removed.

How to use: 
1. The setup file (TheServerArchivesSetup.exe) just downloads the bots code onto your computer. You have to have your own discord bot and have your token ready. Learn how to make a bot and see your token here: https://realpython.com/how-to-make-a-discord-bot-python/ 

2. The setup file will ask for the token to configure the program. If you wish to start over, just delete the files from C:/Program Files/MerlinMDV/TheServerArchives and run the setup file again.

3. The program is located in your AppData/Roaming folder. To use the program, just run it and leave it on. It will start logging all messages to the console and to the THESERVERARCHIVESconfig.ini file with all info on it. DO NOT TAMPER WITH THE INI FILE AS YOU MAY CORRUPT THE PROGRAM.
