# TheServerArchives
An open source Discord bot that allows you to store every message sent.

If you wish to run this bot on a cloud network or raspberry pi, I have left the original code here with the setup checks removed.

How to use: 
1. The setup file just downloads the bots code onto your computer. You have to have your own discord bot and have your token ready. Learn how to make a bot and see your token here: https://realpython.com/how-to-make-a-discord-bot-python/ 

The setup file will ask for the token to configure the program. If you wish to start over, just delete the files from C:/Program Files/MerlinMDV/TheServerArchives and run the setup file again.
