# TheServerArchives
Repository for TheServerArchives Discord bot.

To use: The setup file just downloads the bots code onto your computer. You have to have your own discord bot and have your token ready. The setup file will ask for it to configure the program. If you wish to start over, just delete the files from C:/Program Files/MerlinMDV/TheServerArchives and run the setup file again.
